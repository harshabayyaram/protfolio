            </h3>
            <p>
              The RF-based identification attendance and student monitoring
              system with SMS alerts using Arduino and GSM is an advanced
              solution that automates attendance tracking in educational
              institutions. By utilizing RF technology and Arduino boards,
              students can be uniquely identified through RFID cards or tags,
              ensuring accuracy and efficiency. The system enables real-time
              monitoring of attendance data, which can be instantly updated and
              accessed by teachers, administrators, and parents. Additionally,
              SMS alerts can be sent to notify parents or guardians about
              student absences, facilitating timely communication and
              intervention. This comprehensive system improves accountability,
              reduces manual effort, and enhances the overall educational
              experience.

              Automatic fire detection and control with call and sms alerts to
              fire department and police department
            </h3>
            <p>
              The Automatic Fire Detection and Control system with call and SMS
              alerts to fire and police departments, using Arduino and GSM
              technology, is a cutting-edge solution designed to enhance fire
              safety and emergency response. This system utilizes sensors to
              detect smoke or rapid changes in temperature, triggering an
              immediate alert. By integrating Arduino and GSM modules, the
              system automatically notifies the fire and police departments via
              phone calls and SMS alerts, providing them with crucial
              information about the location and severity of the fire. This
              real-time communication allows for swift and coordinated emergency
              response, reducing the risk of property damage and potential harm
              to human life. The integration of Arduino and GSM technology
              ensures the system's reliability, scalability, and ease of
              implementation, making it an invaluable tool in mitigating fire
              hazards and improving public safety.

              <p>
                During my one-month Virtual Web Developer Internship at Let's
                Grow More, I gained valuable hands-on experience and practical
                skills in web development. Working alongside a talented team, I
                was able to contribute to real-world projects, sharpen my
                proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React
                and Angular, and gain insights into database management, API
                integration, and version control systems. This internship not
                only enhanced my technical expertise but also improved my
                communication, collaboration, and problem-solving abilities in a
                remote work environment. I am grateful for the opportunity to
                have been a part of Let's Grow More, and I am excited to
                leverage my learnings as I continue to grow as a web developer.

              <p>
                During my remote engagement with IETE from October 2022 to
                November 2022, I had the opportunity to explore circuits design
                using MATLAB. As part of the project, I worked extensively with
                MATLAB's circuit simulation and analysis capabilities to create
                and analyze various circuits. I utilized MATLAB's powerful
                functions and tools to design circuits, simulate their behavior,
                and perform analyses such as frequency response, transient
                response, and parameter sweeps. This experience allowed me to
                deepen my understanding of circuit design principles, enhance my
                proficiency in MATLAB, and gain practical insights into circuit
                behavior and performance. Working on this project with IETE
                provided me with valuable hands-on experience in circuit design
                and strengthened my analytical and problem-solving skills.
